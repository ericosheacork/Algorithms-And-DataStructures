# Algorithms-And-DataStructures
Showcasing my journey in learning Linear Algorithms and data structures
This Project entails the use of the stack data structure using the first in first out principal and encorporates the simple node data structure in order to link/organise the data within the stack , 
In this project we learned about the different types of stacks including the dynamic stack which allocates space for new elements as they are needed/created so as to allow for scaling as apposed to the static stack , the double dynamic stack in which the stack has both a head and a tail node to allow for searching from either the newest end of the stack or the oldest nodes , we also incorporated double linked nodes to allow for such a search as the nodes can now point to "both the left and the right" of the position in the stack the node is located.

The second project revolves around dynamic programming using matrixes and implementing backtracking algorithms as well as implementing an algorithm to maximise revenue for a log cutting company.
